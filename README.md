    Addon was taken from https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/trivia-bot
    Where it had not been updated since 2019. 

    Code was fixed, so it works for TWW.

Installation

    Download the repo and put it in a folder with the name "TriviaBot", inside the Addon folder

TriviaBot allows the user to host quiz games for other players.
Spamming it in /say in crowded places or /general is not a good idea,
but Blizzard's spam prevention makes it alot harder to abuse it that way currently.

It's a nice and safe pass-time among consenting adults. :-)
Used best in the custom channel, a party with friends or to liven up that "dead" guild chat.


Usage

    /triviabot or /trivia to bring up it's control panel.
    then you can use the dropdowns to select among different Question Lists and Categories.
    set the output and customize the announce intervals, reporting options etc.

Other Commands

    /trivia help will list other commands.
    !tb help whispered to a game host will list other whisper commands.
